# Restaurants RESTful API

## Overview
The Restaurant API is a RESTful API designed to manage restaurant-related data. The data is divided in 3 tables: Restaurants, Owners and Cities. The API provides endpoints for all CRUD operations. While the restaurant endpoints are private and require JWT token authentication and middleware validation, the other endpoints are publicly accessible.
